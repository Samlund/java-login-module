# java-login-module

A modular and test-driven authentication system built with Spring Boot, featuring JWT-based authentication, password hashing, and RESTful endpoints for registration, login, password updates, and account deletion.

    ⚠️ This project currently exposes a REST API only — a frontend (React) is planned but not yet implemented.
